                <p>Youâ€™re reading aSaaSinator's blog, stuffed with growth hacking strategies that I had experimented in my limited years of experience. 

                    <br> If you want to know when I publish something new, I recommend getting an RSS reader like <a href="https://newsblur.com/">NewsBlur</a> and subscribing to my RSS feed.

                    <br> High privacy and no spamming. :)
